# artoolkitX Camera Calibration Applications

This is a set of applications that allow the user to perform calibration of the intrinsic camera parameters for their device. The result can be saved as an artoolkitX camera calibration parameters file, or uploaded to an artoolkitX camera calibration server. This, along with the calibration server, and the runtime client component, constitute a system for distributed camera calibration generation and retrieval.

## Why is this useful?
Accurate knowledge of the intrinsic optical properties of the camera in an AR system is critical to robust tracking.
